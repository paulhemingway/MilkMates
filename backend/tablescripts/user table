//lastActiveTime: This column stores the date and time of the user's last activity. The default value is NULL, indicating that the user 
//has not yet engaged in any activity.
//isActive: This column is a boolean flag indicating whether the user is currently active or not. The default value is FALSE.
//To implement the 90-day inactivity rule, we can set up a background task that runs periodically and checks for users who have not engaged 
//in any activity for more than 90 days. When such users are found, we can set their isActive flag to FALSE. We can also update their 
//lastActiveTime column to reflect the last time they were active before becoming inactive. This task can be scheduled to run daily or weekly.
