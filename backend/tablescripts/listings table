//isActive: This column stores a boolean value that indicates whether the listing is still active or not. 
//The default value is set to TRUE, which means that a new listing is active by default.
//If the listing has not been updated or viewed for 30 days, we can use a scheduled task to update the isActive column to FALSE.
//lastActiveDateTime: This column stores the date and time when the listing was last active.
//The default value is set to CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, which means that the current date and time will be used as the default value if no value is provided when a new row is inserted.
//With these two columns, we can track the activity status of each listing and automatically toggle the isActive column to FALSE if the listing has been inactive for 30 days.
//This information can be useful for various purposes, such as filtering out inactive listings from search results or displaying a warning message to the users when they view an inactive listing.
